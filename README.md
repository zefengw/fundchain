##FUNDCHAIN
FundChain: Revolutionizing e-commerce with NEAR blockchain, ensuring secure transactions for 1.7M+ Shopify merchants, combating $56B fraud, while promoting mental health through AI chatbot support.

##  ü§î Problem Statement
- The e-commerce industry is evolving rapidly, and there is an increasing demand for decentralized payment solutions. - Shopify, one of the biggest players in the e-commerce industry with over 1.7 million active merchants, processed more than $79.5 billion in sales in 2021. However, it lacks a good way of processing crypto transactions without resorting to centralized exchanges.
- Payments made through centralized exchanges are ultimately settled in US Dollars, limiting the options for merchants and their customers. This lack of an integrated, decentralized payment solution restricts the growth potential of businesses in the new digital economy.
- Consumer fraud is a significant issue in e-commerce. The existing system does not provide a reliable guarantee that goods purchased will be authentic or that they will even be delivered, leading to increased mistrust among online shoppers.
- The Federal Trade Commission reported 2.2 million instances of fraud in 2020, leading to a total financial loss of $3.3 billion. This prevalent problem of fraud continues to dent customer trust and affects the overall growth and reputation of the e-commerce industry.
- There is an urgent need for a system that provides a clear, unalterable proof of purchase to protect consumers from fraud. The current systems in place lack this capability, which increases the risk for consumers when purchasing goods online.
- Lastly, mental health issues associated with financial scams and frauds are rising. A personal incident wherein a friend suffered from mental health problems after being scammed emphasizes the urgent need to address this issue and contribute to mental health causes.

## üí° Inspiration
- Shopify, a major e-commerce platform with over 1.7 million active merchants, processed more than $79.5 billion in sales in 2021. Yet, it lacks a system for processing crypto transactions, which represents a significant gap in the market.
